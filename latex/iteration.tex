\chapter{Iterating over sparse matrix formats}

\section{Compressed column format} 

Iterating over a sparse matrix in CC format can be defined as follows.
I have not checked into more efficient methods.  This method allows you
to iterate with $i$ and $j$ in hand.

\begin{verbatim}
for j in 1 to n:
  if z[j] != 0:
    for q in u[j] to (u[j]+z[j]-1):
      i = v[q];
      xij = w[q];
\end{verbatim}
